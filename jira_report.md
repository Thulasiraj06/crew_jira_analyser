   - **Action Required**: Implementing rate limiting strategies is crucial to enhance security.

## Dependency Analysis
### Dependencies & Blockers
- **AUTH-501** (Critical vulnerability) has no dependencies but is an urgent issue that requires immediate resolution.
- **AUTH-502** (Session fixation) depends on **AUTH-501**; therefore, its resolution is crucial for addressing the session management issue.
- **AUTH-503** requires enhancements after resolving **AUTH-504**, which currently blocks progress on this issue.
- **AUTH-504** needs to be resolved to enable proper handling of login attempts.
